# SynchronyMeasures-Robustness
Scripts and data used for the publication "Comparison of different spike train synchrony measures regarding their robustness to erroneous data from bicuculline induced epileptiform activity"

In order to run the Matlab (version 2019a was used) scripts:
1) unzip the spike train data "MEA-TS-Data.zip" in the folder "01_CalcSync".
2) unzip "DrCell.zip" to get all functions that are used by the scripts (Note: an up2date DrCell version will be uploaded to its own repository in the future). Add all functions into your Matlab path manually or by executing DrCell.m.
